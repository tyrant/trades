  # Trader Creation:
  # This involves one of three actions.
  #   (1) A customer creates a new inactive Trader instance: Customers, when Reviewing a Job, need to select a Trader
  #       for this, and if the Trader in question isn't yet on the site, they can create a new, inactive Trader instance.
  #       This instance creates a temporary login and plaintext password, to be sent to the Trader in question, should 
  #       the flesh-and-blood Trader view the site, see they're being talked about, say "now just a cotton-pickin' minute",
  #       and demand to take control of this Trader model. For more on the mechanics of that, see (3). Here, though, the
  #       following fields need setting: self.active = false, self.login = [six random characters], self.password = 
  #       [six random characters], and self.question = [whatever question the customer writes].
  #   (2) A user (a real-life trader) creates a new Trader profile for themselves. Standard Rails stuff.
  #   (3) (Not Trader#create, but relevant) A user holds the opinion that they're the Trader being discussed on the site, 
  #       and asserts as much. This is handled by the Customer who created the Trader instance also adding a secret question
  #       that, presumably, only the Trader knows, so that the Trader can then answer it. The possible-Trader's answer will
  #       be emailed to the Customer, who then confirms or denies the question's correctness. If it's right, the trader will 
  #       then be asked for an email/password, the temporary ones will be wiped, the 'sprightly' flag will be set to True,
  #       and then they can behave, on the site, as the Trader in question.
